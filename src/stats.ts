/**
 * This is Quirk's public stats file and is part of the
 * Open-Quirk project.
 *
 * **What's the Open Quirk Project?**
 * Quirk should be open; code _and_ stats. Typically,
 * a developer gets stats through the app stores, and even
 * if the app is open source, those stats tend to be kept
 * private.
 *
 * Quirk's not gonna be like that. Instead, stats will
 * be shared openly.
 *
 * That let's community members:
 * - understand the status of the project
 * - see the fruits of their support
 *
 * Plus, it allows researchers and mental health professionals
 * access the info in order to develop better treatments.
 *
 * These stats are valuable data that's created by
 * you, the user. **So you, the user, should have access to it.**
